There are four versions of the model

	1. "ba" the standard model
	2. "ba-rag", **more ragged**		
	3. "ba-rag-ranef", like "ba-rag" but with hierarchical fitting of clusterwise parameters
	0.  "ba-rect" entirely **unragged** model for simple testing purposes, otherwise entirely like ba

"ba_rag" (2) and "ba-rag-ranef" (3) are not tested in this version!
For details on  models, see file "Notes_ba.md".
