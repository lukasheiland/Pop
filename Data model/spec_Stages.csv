explanation,id of the plot,Essential! Cluster of 1 or multiple plots.,"id of a taxon, usually looked up in a taxon data base, but could be the same as tax",taxon handling name,"The stages. All stages should have values in count_obs. J and A should also have values in count_ha, B and BA should also have values in ba_ha. BA is non-essential (just potentially used for residuals etc.)","id of the survey, i.e. inventory iteration","Required. id of the sampling protocol, in case it was changed over time. This introduces levels for the dispersion parameter in the likelihood, but only in some versions of the model. Check!",Data of plot sampling,count per hectare,basal area per hectare,real sampling area,sampled counts on real sampling area,"observed basal area on a plot. Substantial to compute the average BA for A, ba_a_avg = mean(ba_obs/count_obs, na.rm = T), which is used in the transition from A to B.","the factor that links count_obs to ba_ha and is used as offset for B in the JAB model. Usually offset_ba_ha is calculated per plot as  offset_ba_ha = (count_obs_plot/ba_obs_plot) * area_plot [ha/m2]
For count_obs_plot == 0, an empiriical average per tax/obsid within B is used, as in mean(count_ha/ba_ha, na.rm = T),  (after zero completion!).",offset used in the JAB model. Usually area_obs for J and A; offset_ba_ha for B,Is this a plot that never was a forest and is only used as a grid point in the complete grid to fit a spatial smooth for background bassal area? A isnonforest == TRUE plot should have ba_ha == 0.0 for all species and should include geocoordinates.,should the plot or observation be used in the JAB and transition prior model fits (or just for the smooth). Usually this will be FALSE when the plot had non-natural disturbances.,geocoordinate,geocoordinate
