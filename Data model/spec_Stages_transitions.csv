explanation,id of the plot,taxon handling name,"id of the PERIOD BETWEEN TWO SURVEYS. Factually of the last survey. But this is stressed here, to make the data structure clear.","Count of trees per hectare that appeared in B in the specific period, regardless of alive or dead","Count of trees per hectare that appeared in A in the specific period, regardless of alive or dead",truly observed count,truly observed count,"The sum of the counts [per hectare!] that the population of J had over the discrete years of the specific period. E.g., if J was assumed to be constant = 10 over a reference period of 3 years, count_J_integr_plot = 3 * 10 == 30.
The assumption of count_J2A ~ (count_J_integr * g) is used int model, e.g. for count_J2A == 6, g == 0.2. [In the model there is an area offset on the RHS, so that count_J_integr is per hectare!]

For DE_BWI, count_J_integr is an average calculated by special linear interpolation between the two observed states over the period in countTransitions()

Plots within periods and species that do not have a base population (j_integr, a_integr) will get dropped before fitting!","The sum of the counts [per hectare!] that the population of A had over the discrete years of the specific period. E.g., if A was assumed to be constant = 10 over a reference period of 3 years, count_A_integr_plot = 3 * 10 == 30.
Analogous to count_J_integr_plot.",Area on which count_A2B_plot_obs is observed,Area on which count_J2A_plot_obs is observed
